The application reads Coronavirus data from a source (Worldometers.com), processes the data, and writes the data to text files and excel files.
The path of the excel files need to be configured under the filename String variable located three times in each class starting with "Three". 
The text files are automatically generated. 
The application uses two API's / Libraries: JXL API and the Jsoup Library.
