Code Created By Rayhan B.
This applications tracks various Coronavirus dataum by reading data from a source (Worldometers.info), processing the data, and writing the data into text files and excel sheets. 
Recent Features: I added a feature for which all data will be automatically synced into an sqlite database that you can configure. This data will be organized into distinct tables such as "State_Cases" or "Country_Cases". 
Note***: If you want to export this project into a JAR file, make sure to put all external libraries such as the JSOUP or JDBC Driver into the jar file, which can be done through the Eclipse IDE.
